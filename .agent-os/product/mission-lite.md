# Product Mission (Lite)

Smart Quote System is an international logistics quoting platform for Goodman GLS & J-Ways that instantly calculates shipping costs across UPS, DHL, and EMAX carriers with real-time cost breakdowns, margin analysis, and quote persistence.

The platform serves two audiences: internal operations staff (via /admin) who generate and manage quotes daily, and external customers (via /dashboard) who access self-service quoting with real-time port weather alerts and logistics news. Unlike manual quoting workflows, Smart Quote runs identical calculation logic on frontend and backend simultaneously, delivering instant UI responsiveness with backend-validated accuracy across 200+ destination countries.
